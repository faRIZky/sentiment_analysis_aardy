Purchase experience only,"This review is based only on my purchase experience, as I have not had occasion to make a claim. I appreciate that AARDY gives you access to the fine print of the policies they offer before you purchase, but reading through the fine print can be confusing. Christiana was very helpful in guiding me towards the coverage options that I cared most about so that I would buy a policy that met my needs. It turned out to not be the cheapest policy on offer, but it was still about 30% cheaper than what my travel agent was offering and with the features that I really wanted. We’ll see what happens if I actually make a claim."

CFAR policy doesn’t cover mental illness,"Beware that a cancel for any reason policy does not cover mental illness. My husband was going through a manic episode when he booked a trip. After numerous phone calls trying to file a claim, I was told “mental illness is excluded. Even regarding CFAR polices, all policies require that you are medically fit for travel at the time of purchase otherwise none of the coverages apply, for anyone.” This statement was made by a representative from Aardy. This is just another loophole by an insurance company to deny a claim. They may want to make it clear that no one with a mental illness should take out CFAR policy."

Aardy shows list of providers with prices, policy details and customer ratings. I found Aardy through AARP site and included discount from standard prices. We selected highly rated provider at reasonable price. Customer service people actually answer the phone to answer your questions. I had asked about comparing the details of the coverage between three providers. The representative went through them and explained what the differences are in which items are less important to consider keeping or removing. We had the policy emailed within minutes and had seven days after accepting the offer to cancel in case we changed our minds once we saw the complete policy documents or just had a change of mind."

Be Aware Before You Buy Any Travel…,"Be Aware Before You Buy Any Travel Insurance
Purchased from AARDY.com which is an insurance market place. The Company they recommended was Trawick Armor. SureGo is the Administrative Service and the policy is underwritten by Starr Indemnity & Liability Company.
The situation: Our step mother went to Finland to visit her family which she had been doing every two years. She began to feel ill while she was there. After visiting the hospital and getting results from the test done there, she was told that she was no longer in remission and had days to a couple of weeks to live. We immediately began to make plans to get to her because she was too ill to make it back home. Since our tickets were non-refundable, we thought it would be best to purchase insurance to cover them. My sister and I called several times and spoke to different people explaining our situation. We were assured every time that our situation would be covered should she pass away before our travel took place. We purchased the insurance to cover the roundtrip tickets of 4 people for $10,000. We were notified that she passed away the day before we were to leave. All the airlines involved that we purchased non refundable tickets from, refunded the tickets except for one (Icelander). I figured, no problem, I purchased travel insurance just for this situation so we should be fine for the $4,448 that was not refunded. Also, on the day we were to travel, Microsoft had a software glitch (CrowdStrick) which would be considered an unforeseeable situation that day. Had our step mother lived, we would not have been able to fly on our scheduled flight anyway.
This insurance company has denied our claim and our appeal. I am now having to go down the legal venue and also report them to the Insurance Commissions.
What I thought was purchasing something to give us protection and peace of mind, has turned into a nightmare. This has been going on now for 10 months. They will gladly take your money, but that is all they will be doing.
You have been warned!!"

I did call regarding a few questions after my purchase and customer service answered all my questions. My only comment is that there is no creation of an account to access the policy on the web.To access the policy after purchase, you must enter your email and wait for a email response that includes a link. Using the link, your policy comes up. Seems cumbersome especially if I was on the go and wanted to double check the exact words on the policy. Bothered me but can live with it. Other than that, so far the process works great, as was customer service I received."

Chose AARDY for BBBa+ & AARPa+ ratings,"I called AARDY after looking at several travel insurance companies. Mainly because of BBB & AARP a+ ratings.
I trust both organisations & when I called at 5.45 pm on Saturday 8th March I was put through very quickly.
I am traveling to UK next week and after giving me a quote for $ 643.83 covering all cancellations of travel plans and medical. I asked DENISE, if there were something less expensive.
DENISE was very professional and polite and thorough and very nice. She offered another policy. If I were only interested in medical help & evacuations, (except pre-existing conditions), and not cancellations of travel plans
The cost actually went down to a very reasonable amount less than $100.00 dollars.
In these fearful times of the decimation of our government agencies & the possible loss of our Social Security & Medicare (which we've paid into our entire working lives AND pay large costs for our Medicare & ""Advantage Plus"" costs to ensure we are covered by the private insurance companies), it is especially helpful that I'm able to purchase traveller's insurance at a reasonable cost to ensure I'm covered and protected.
Demise seemed to understands this situation and was very helpful. I believe you can find a good deal for piece of mind w/out adding more stress of large costs, for something we, fingers crossed 🤞, we won't need."

Never again! Coverage limits so low doesn't cover cost of the policy!,"Do NOT use this company! It's a waste. Is it easy? Yes. Is it good? NO!! You give up your control over your policy. Our pay-out limits for ""typical"" claims were so low, it didn't even cover the cost of the policy! Insurance is only good if it helps when you need it - this site is just worthless. RUN! The coverage you're about to get will cover a few things, but payouts so low, you won't get the cost associated with buying off this site back. Save your money! Many people giving high marks for ease of purchase, but more important, how is the claim process. Horrible from the company I got from them. Site outdated, not easy to navigate. And very clearly hoping you you do NOT make a successful claim. I've worked with other, large companies, and their processes are easy, logical and have quick payouts. Not so with the one AARDY set me up with. RUN!"

I called Jayson for help, he mentioned an AARP discount rate and when I got the link quote it didn't show, so I called him to purchase my policy- He is very thorough and helpful. He said you are looking into the error. Also, even though your company is highly rated, the really important part of travel insurance is if you need to make a claim. In researching IMG reviews, there a ALOT of VERY negative reviews for how claims are processed. I still purchased the policy- as it is very hard to find great reviews for any companies. It's disappointing the culture of Travel Ins has such a bad reputation. As a consumer you go in with little confidence these days that your claims will be easy- we come to understand that carries work harder to find ways to deny than actually making it the seamless process it should be. Just my own opinion/experience. I hope I never have to file a claim with your companies, but if I do, I know I am in for a real headache! I will be diligent about documenting everything!! Thanks for listening!"

Your agents --The reason to chose AARDY,"Your agent Peter was the reason I went with AARDY. He was exceptionally knowledgeable and professional. He also was pleasant to converse with. Given all the options for insurance - the variations within one company's offerings and the variations between companies, I was constantly getting confused. Peter laid out what he thought was worthwhile and what options were probably unnecessary given out circumstances. He did not push, he did not try to induce us to buy the most expensive alternative. I should add that there was some misinformation about us in your computer system. Peter said he would fix it and notify us when that was done. He lived up to his word.

My first encounter with an AARDY agent was George. He too was quite helpful. When I called back Peter answered so he was the one who arranged our insurance. I have nothing but praise for both of them.

I did talk to an agent at one of your competitors and felt that she was much less interested in being helpful -- and indeed, much less informed."
Peter R,Peter R. is the agent who helped me. He explained everything about my different choices and was very patient. He returned my phone calls promptly. I would definitely use Ardy again.

When I needed to call back to make a change they were incredibly responsive. Furthermore, rather than pushing me to purchase and review my policy online, they actually encouraged me to do it over the phone so they could answer any questions real time.

I spoke with Peter, Amanda and Sylvia and they were all wonderful and answered all my questions. Insurance can be confusing and they cleared it up for me. The hardest one for me was the look back period and the the Time Sensitive period. I kept thinking I couldn't get insured because of the time sensitive period of my 1st deposit was too long ago but that was not the case. If I had gotten insurance as soon as I made my 1st deposit on my trip I wouldn't of had to worry about look back periods. So, get the insurance and as your payments for your trip go up make adjustments to your insurance. This way you're insured and locked in tight.

Fortunately, have never needed but we get peace of mind."

Purchase experience,"When I was online to purchase the policy, my iMac warned me it would not retrieve my credit card information because your site was not encrypted. These messages make me nervous. I spoke with Destiny and she walked me through the process and took my information. Chatbots don't do that. Also, I do wish you and other providers offered more customization of coverage, i.e. we don't need medical or repatriation of remains coverage, but would like trip cancellation and interruption coverage. It's apparently impossible across several insurers."

Peter was a find.....I highly recommend…,"Peter was a find.....I highly recommend him to source out the appropriate travel insurance for one's needs. I had purchased a more expensive policy from another company and he took the time ( and great deal effort I might add as I ask a prodigious amount of detailed questions) to compare and contrast both policies with me and we JOINTLY concluded that the policy I ended up purchasing was substantially similar with one exception; he also patiently allowed me to walk through some hypotheticals so I could see how each of provisions would play out. He was honest about his answers and would indicate that he did not know when he didn't but checked on the few questions he could not answer. I got the strong impression that he would have told me that the other policy was superior and worth the extra 1,500 I would have spent (basically the old policy had a more generous notice requirement on the CFAR but was over 20% of my cruise cost). Finally, he did not pressure me after all the time spent. He won me over with the facts not bravado. I would highly recommend him to friends for their travel insurance needs as this is a fairly complex topic and he affords one the time to digest the information, an important asset in his line of work. I feel at peace about my decision because of him."

Since this was my first time purchasing travel insurance, it was imperative for me to understand all of the Information so that I did not make the mistake and still lose out on top of insurance not covering whatever can happen. The agent that I spoke with was fantastic who took an awful lot of time to make sure that the Insurance was Taylor fit for me after telling her where I was going to how much I was spending And a brief synopsis of the things that might happen if I had to cancel, I no longer had to give any further explanations. By the time she chose a plan for me. She did more thinking about it for me than I had to for myself. Bravo… In today’s world, customer service constantly falls below the wayside , in every aspect of life, I’m sure many of you can agree. This agent was fantastic to say that minimizes how excellent she was. By mistake I called that number thinking it was a different number on my cell phone and of course it was after hours, do you know the next day I got a phone call from this company asking me if everything was OK !
What more can one ask for?
This is obviously accompany. That’s success is driven by its excellent reputation. I call it old-fashioned customer service. Travel insurance is something that you purchase and hope you never have to use. If I do, God forbidden this case, I have absolutely no worries… Thank you so much!"

Easier Than I Thought!,"Picking a specific travel policy was a new experience for me and felt overwhelming with so many options from which to choose. I was pleased to find your site and its comprehensive listing of various options. I realized I had questions and was happy there was a phone number listed. I called and was greeted in a very professional manner by Shauna ( not sure if that is the correct spelling of her name). My question was immediately answered, which led to a very informative introduction by Shauna to the site and the various aspects to consider when selecting a travel policy. We are traveling to Norway and live in Illinois. Shauna directed my attention to the difference in rates for reimbursement for medical evacuation, noting a policy different from the one I was considering offered double the amount for medical evacuation. I chuckled when she helpfully noted that Illinois was a long way from Norway! Thoughtfully, Shauna did not comment on the fact that I am 80 and probably should make medical evacuation an important consideration for my travel policy! Just one example of how Shauna professionally and deftly helped me compare policies, recommending one that had the best coverage for our party’s needs for the best price. What a relief! Many thanks to your company for the very helpful compilation of travel policy options and to Shauna for her expert and knowledgeable guidance in helping me select the best policy for my group. Travel policy shopping made easy! Thanks!!!

The summaries of coverage were understandable, with clickable explanations afforded. The sign-up process was a cinch. I cannot attest to the accuracy of the representations regarding the price, coverages, and reliability of the insurer selected, but at present I have no reason to doubt their verity.

The very best part of my experience was the inteaction that I have with agent Christianna.,"The very best part of my experience with AARDY was the conversation that I had with Christianna on my initial call on May 1, 2024. I had several questions about travel insurance and Christianna was extremely helpful. In addition to annswering all of my questions, Christianna actually anticipated some things that I needed to know and proactively provided more useful information. Christianna made me feel comfortable with my insurance queries and was helpful without pressuring me to make a purchase. AARDY has done a great job training agents as far I can see from my experience with Christianna.

I addition to my great customer service experience, I love that AARDY provides comprehesive travel insurance quotes from a variety of vendors without unnecessary entry of my personal information.

As a result of my great experience with AARDY, I purchased travel policies for myself and my two adult sons who reside in other states and who are joining me on a May trip to Great Britain.

My wife and I have a trip planned to Portugal in August and I am sure we will consult AARDY for our travel insurance needs for that trip."

We’d planned a Greek Isles cruise with…,"We’d planned a Greek Isles cruise with friends who are experienced world travelers. They’re the type who read all the fine print in every document related to a trip. They felt that while the travel insurance included with the cruise line’s reservation was pretty standard and covered most things adequately, there were a couple of coverages they felt needed to be ‘enhanced’. They contacted the cruise line and asked if their travel insurance could be upgraded in a couple areas and were told no, they didn’t offer that option. So, after some research, our friends opted to drop the cruise line’s travel insurance and purchase a policy with the higher limits they wanted from another provider. That provider was Aardy.com. Our friends gave us the information, I called the number and ‘Don’ answered my call. I told Don the situation and that we felt the need to enhance our travel coverage as well based on our friend’s recommendation. Don handled everything! He didn’t put me on hold or transfer my call to someone else. He checked our friends policy and put together a similar quote for us. He even noticed an important coverage on our friend’s policy that was no longer available to us because the period for getting that coverage had expired. But he found us a different policy with that same important coverage at comparable cost. Aardy.com and Don have nailed what outstanding ‘customer service’ really is!"

"The AARDY representative, Dennis is WONDERFUL!","The AARDY representative, Dennis, was wonderful!! She listened to my concerns, answered all my questions, and was very informative. She pulled up my quote after giving her my phone number. We reviewed the John Hancock Silver Plan that I was interested in pursuing. It's important to note that they have multiple quotes for a wide range of cost. Dennis went over how much our trip cost and what was the recommended medical coverage as well as medical evacuation coverage. Please note that this coverage is for each traveler which was one of my questions. This plan met our needs in price, for medical assistance as well as medical evacuation. The plan also had 100% cancellation refund and 150% Travel Interruption. I was on the fence about getting travel insurance since I took out the insurance for my hotels. Family and Friends highly recommended travel insurance. I went out to the US State Website, and Insurance was STRONGLY recommended as well as to register on Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP): Subscribe to get up-to-date safety and security information and help us reach you in an emergency abroad. This is my first time going to Europe and with all the things going on in Europe our State Department definitely inspired me to get this Travel Insurance AND enroll in STEP. I liked that our government would notify the US Consulate of my location in the 4 countries and 7 cities we are visiting in Europe. I did look up the addresses of each US Consulate in the various cities and put them in my documentation for this trip. I may not need this information, but I do like to be prepared. AARDY has a good rating from The Better Business Bureau which is important to me. I also like that I'm able to reach out to AARDY 24/7 if I need assistance. I looked at other travel insurance but felt that the variety of coverages offered and with various companies, AARDY was better than the other travel insurance I found online."

She had me click on the Policy Document link to help explain things. And after I made my decision to proceed, I was able to finish the process directly with her -- not have to finish via the website.

Why I made AARDY my choice.,"I made AARDY our choice for travel insurance after researching the details of many companies and brands for weeks. But, it wasn't the brain boggling details within the policy itself that ultimately caused me to make my decision. My decision to buy travel insurance with AARDY was made because of the highly informative people that I spoke with. I called many times with questions. There was never any pressure to finalize, there was always great records of conversations kept with each contact, which made new conversations easy to build upon. The people were easy to hear, easy to understand and extremely knowledgeable. My first contact was Christianna, followed by: Melanie, Brandon, Don and Amanda. Each one of them were excellent and helpful. Their voices provided a calm and clear cohesiveness. It became apparent that the experts are not working on commission, and after thinking about it, I believe that fact may be what builds the AARDY company with great people. Being a novice in this field, it was a daunting task to review and learn about travel insurance, but the team I worked with, made this experience into a trusting relationship. Thank you Team AARDY."

GREAT Chat folks…,"They have very knowledgeable Chat folks and they are NOT a BOT. It is a real person who answers your specific question in language you can understand. The price they quoted for the AIG policy is the exact same price as going to AIG. I stayed with AARDY because they took the time to answer my questions. And when they couldn't answer a question, they told me to go straight to AIG for an answer. I believe in loyalty. The only thing, which I'm not sure is AARDY's fault, when I googled/binged ""travel insurance"", it was intimated that AARDY is affiliated with AARP. They are not and you get no discount by being an AARP member."

She was very nice, extremely helpful and humorous at times, which made for a pleasant conversation. I called back a few days later to speak with Amanda, but she was in a meeting, so Melanie helped me complete my purchase based on Amanda's recommendation.

Extra security for travelers,All we have done so far is purchase the policy. That was easy to do. The information provided was informative.

It would work in conjunction with our medical insurance plan. Fingers crossed.

Superb company,"From the moment I started to deal with this company last year, I have had superior service from every agent I spoke with.
Coming from a professional occupation that was competitive and commission based, I was very tuned in to going back to who helped me. In this case, at Aardy, they are not commission based. Every time I called, I was told not to worry the person I was on the phone with could help me and help indeed they did. Insurance is confusing and picking the right plan is important. They went over and above explaining the differences of one company over another, and one plan over another. I would like to say that they work as a team the way it should be and they each help each other out. When I booked a trip last year, I had superb service from Sylvia.
Since she was not available a few times, when I was ready to book some other insurance, I had the pleasure of working with the following people who also were top-notch and exemplary. They are as follows:
Melanie S. and Katrina who ultimately booked the insurances I picked.
Stacey, Nicole,Katrina,and Don for helping me narrow down my choices and answering numerous question.

Peace of Mind,"In my own candid opinion, the most important thing in getting a travel insurance for the duration of a trip is the peace of mind that the policy owner gets that he/she is protected in the event that an unforeseen event or circumstance happens during the trip. Such peace of mind can only occur when the traveler is convinced that the insurance consultant he/she is talking to is knowledgeable, reassuring, calm, and patient in explaining the rudiments and caveats of a travel insurance. Such consultant is Maranda M with whom I have the pleasure of talking with. Maranda has convinced me on what plan to get and the company (IMG) that is behind the policy. Maranda has my complete trust on travel insurance and I look forward to getting travel insurance with her next year as I try to fulfill the items in my travel bucket list.

"Aardy is our ""go to"" for travel insurance!",Aardy.com is so simple to use to get a quote. The variety of plans is ample. Excellent insurance companies are offered. We've had to unfortunately make a claim previously and the claim process went off without a hitch. We have used Aardy.com numerous times now and always tell our friends to take a look at their site for their travel insurance. We learned several years ago that it's best to NOT buy the vendor's travel insurance because it's much more expensive and doesn't give you the coverage like an Aardy company will. Much more expansive!
Easy to purchase,"Easy to purchase, no issues so far. Seem to be a great company."

Very easy.,"The experience of navigating through the question to process the insurance policy was easy. Immediately I could compare the different insurance one to others. I appreciate that there weren't any unnecessary questions. However, I needed to ask questions regarding my trip, and I was able to get that confirmation of my concerns right away. Thank you for that."

Wonderful representatives and helpful offerings!,"My very first contact with AARDY was this past summer. I was impressed with how the representative was doing his best to find a solution even though we determined that AARDY did not have a plan that suited my needs. (I also needed personal liability included in the travel medical which is an uncommon pairing in the US as I learned.) But even though I didn't purchase anything from AARDY that time, the rep left a positive impression on me!

So today as I was preparing for another trip (for which I do not need personal liability), I remembered AARDY and went to the company website. From the chat with Sarah via the website to the phone calls with Nicole all the way to the final emails, I felt the process was seamless!

During our webchat, Sarah also offered to have someone call us in case that was helpful.

When Nicole called us, she was able to understand our concerns and highlight the corresponding features of the plan proposed for us so that we didn't need to buy more insurance than we needed. Sometimes one can feel overwhelmed with all the benefits and coverage components, but thanks to Nicole, I felt like I understood what I needed to know. I also appreciated that travelers in two different age categories could be handled within the same plan.

The lookback period of the plan they proposed is less than some of the other plans out there so that's worth keeping in mind if you are looking for travel medical insurance.

When we made our final decision, it was wonderful to call back and be able to conclude the purchase with Nicole. Thank you!"
Melanie was extremely knowledgeable…,Melanie was extremely knowledgeable regarding the products and provided invaluable assistance in selecting the right plan for our needs. Thank you again Melanie!!!

I selected a recommended policy and paid for it. When I received the confirmation email, I went to double-check the policy and found that my name was listed as both the primary and secondary insured person. Not sure where the web processing messed that up, but certainly the checks for issuing a policy should ensure that the same person isn't listed multiple times. So then I had to call in to get the change made, wait on hold several times, receive instructions for how to modify the policy, and then find out it may take longer for that change to take effect than the time we'll be away on the trip! The person on the phone tried to be helpful, but this experience makes me doubt I'll use this site again, even though we've been consistent users for many years."

RE: double charge for travel insurance,"RE: Policies TCLX284024468 and TCLX284024469

Updated review regarding our recent travel insurance purchase.

Though we were initially very pleased with the service, subsequent developments necessitate contacting you.

It turns out that two insurance policies were issued, rather than one. I was unaware of this until I checked my VISA credit card account regarding the end of our billing cycle. I then noted your company had submitted to our credit card two charges, each in the amount of $1514.60. We called your company on 9/19/23. The agent cancelled policy TCLX284024469, issuing a credit to our VISA account.

However, the email regarding this cancellation stated it would take 3-8 business for the refund to post to our account.

The result is that I have had to now pay 2 charges, each in the amount of $1514.60 to my credit card company since the billing cycle has ended. I now have to wait for my refund that will appear on my next credit card statement.

Needless to say, these developments have made me rather unhappy with the service provided.

AARDY Provided An Awesome Purchase Experience!,"An Awesome Experience!
I had researched multiple providers of travel insurance to cover my wife and I on our upcoming overseas trip. So many of them, although packed with information, were not very clear on their products they were selling. That was until I found AARDY.com. The website clearly defined all of the options that met our 40 day trip with cruise. I had additional questions, so I called their number. I talked with Janet. Within a few minutes of discussing the online quote AARDY had provided, she had fully clarified my questions with clear and concise answers. Through our discussion, we were able to fine tune the policy requirements to meet our needs and allow me to make a decision regarding procuring the policy. Janet's positive attitude about customer service being a priority made this a very easy decision to purchase the IMG SE Policy."

Seamless Insurance Exploration with AARDY,"Navigating through AARDY's website is a breeze, with concise comparison options that hit the mark. Having conducted preliminary research, I honed in on the crucial coverage aspects for both myself and my companion. The policy comparison tool on the website adeptly handled most of these facets. When I had lingering inquiries, I turned to the helpline. Amanda's demeanor exuded composure, professionalism, and amiability. She not only responded promptly but also went the extra mile, providing elaborate explanations in real-time rather than making me wait for a callback. The policy I ultimately procured post-discussion with Amanda came at roughly half the cost of the one I had painstakingly researched on another platform, where a chat bot led me on a fruitless quest to address rudimentary queries. AARDY's team is undeniably a valuable resource. I wholeheartedly endorse the website to fellow travelers seeking insurance solutions."

Good Service and Good Prices,"AARDY's website is easy to navigate, and the options it gives for comparison are to the point. I had done some research ahead of time and narrowed down the most important coverage for me and my companion. Most of those details were covered by the policy comparison function on the web page. For my remaining questions, I called the help line. Amanda was calm, professional, and friendly, and took extra pains to go into detail as we were talking (no waiting for a call-back). The policy I bought after speaking to Amanda cost about half the price of the one I had previously researched elsewhere (on a site where a chat bot sent me in circles trying to answer basic questions). AARDY's people are a great asset! I recommend the site to other travelers."

Outstanding customer service,"If you're in the market for trip insurance, RUN, don't walk, to tripinsure101.com!! I found them accidentally while researching the myriad, overwhelming options for trip insurance out there and was pleasantly surprised by the experience. Christiane answered the phone immediately (no hold times or annoying AI) and it was clear I was dealing with a knowledgable professional (not someone at a call center pushing a particular product).

After carefully listening and getting the details of my dream trip to India, Christiane quickly whittled my choices down to a few insurers with salient options based on my circumstance, recommended coverage limits, reimbursement rates, etc. She even held my hand through checking what coverage was available with my credit card to alleviate my concerns about having overlapping policies and insurers pointing the finger if I needed to file a claim.

Christiane then went above and beyond by allowing me time to check with my health insurer about their coverage for international travel. We hung up, and incredibly, she called me back on the dot at the agreed upon time. What vendor does that these days?!

Long story short, tripinsure101.com and Christiane alleviated all the anxiety, confusion, and stress around selecting the right trip insurance coverage for my dream trip. She coordinated the coverage beautifully around everything I already had in place to avoid overlap and provide me with the best, most affordable rate. There was no hard sell and I was treated with the utmost respect and courtesy. I am beyond satisfied and would highly recommend this service."

Melanie S,"Melanie S. helped me today and when I say she went beyond the call of duty, it doesn’t define the level of help she gave.
She was patient with me from the very beginning with identifying the coverage for me since a relative had already purchased the plan as well as informing me of the necessary documents I should have with me during my travels. Additionally, she shared with me all of the services I’d have access to with my coverage. She was literally walking me through eeeverrything because I was clueless. I never felt rushed or if I was an inconvenience. Heck with that level of help I wasn’t thinking about the extra money I was spending because I felt I could trust her guidance. It’s my hope she’s treated well all around by the company she’s working for. It was nice to have great service when spending my money for a product."

It was so nice to get a live person who is a native English speaker to help me. Together, we quickly reviewed my information, and she clarified some terms such as look back period. Andrea did not try to upsell me on anything. In less than ten minutes I had my policy paid for and sent to me via email. I am so relieved to have exactly the right coverage at a good price. I highly recommend using this service. I imagine all of their agents are great, but I can say with certainty that Andrea is superb. I now have peace of mind that I have superior coverage for my upcoming cruise."

Easy Selection of Policy and Communication,"Purchased a travel policy for an upcoming trip to Europe, and was offered a number of policies from which to choose. Once I had made a selection, the application process was simple and straightforward.
I was told after filling out the application that I would receive my policy by email within about 2 hours from the insurer. When I did not receive the email within a few days, I contacted AARDY and they asked if I had checked my SPAM folder. I admitted that I had not, so I was immediately sent the policy by email. Suggestion: when looking for return email, check your inbox as well as spam. The delay was, in all likelihood, my fault, so I was treated well by AARDY."

"insure what you have paid for, not what you intend to buy","Before calling Trip Insure 101, I had made phone contact with four well known agencies. My husband and I had many meaningful conversations with all of them. We were late in beginning insuring our trip due to some coomplications in our plans; my doctor said I could not join in the Zespa rides for 6 days. We modified my plans which caused us to be late in planning. As we finished asking the very informed and polite agent, Stacy, she advised us not to use a ballpark figure for our policy, but to insure what we had spent our money on already. Instead of estimating our cost at $15,0000.00 I realized that our costs were actually within $12,0000 expense mark. The quote was adusted and my insurance was less than half of the original quote! That made my husband and I thrilled. Thank you Stacy!"

I shopped around and spoke with several agents who were lacking in every way compared to Sydney and Don. Also impressive was Aardy's software, ie, instant recognition based on my phone number, the impact of this and Aardy representative excellence being reduced redundancy, customer time spent, and stress. I would highly recommend Aardy to anyone. Thanks for the outstanding help."

Hopefully I will never have to file a claim, but if I do, I hope they are just as helpful."

Wow- Excellent Customer Service on a Saturday evening!,"Wow! I was going down the travel insurance rabbit hole. So many providers & 3rd party sites but many with questionable reviews. I went to Trustpilot and entered travel insurance, AARDY popped up with impressive reviews. I went to AARDY's site (again). In all my ""investigating"" I had been to the site. I went into a chat. The representative(s) were quick to respond and could see I had already entered a search. I spoke with Sarah first, who was super helpful as she directed me to the type of carrier/policy I was looking for with an A+ rating. I got disconnected, my error, but got connected with Felicia who was also very helpful and asked if I wanted to talk directly with an agent. She connected me with Nicole who called me immediately to walk me through a couple things. All this on a Saturday evening at 6 pm! Now I have a policy I am comfortable with, backed by reputable agency. Their customer service was impeccable and I think that's what made me so comfortable (note: I'm in a customer service role and really picky about that). Save yourself time and headache, go to AARDY first and if you have questions, use the chat!"
easy to find the insurance we needed.,
AN UNUSAULLY PLEASANT EXPERIENCE.,"My experience started with contacting aardy.com and leaving my phone number for a call back. Within a few minutes Felicia returned my call and after quickly discerning what I wanted she quickly connected me to Sylvia, I believe possibly Ferguson with tripinsure101.com, a subsidiary of aardy.com.

Sylvia asked logical questions to determine my needs for an appropriate medical/travel insurance policy. She quickly, professionally with details explained my options and responded to my many questions with answers that I could understand. Sylvia is a very patient person.

Sylvia was very easy to talk with and at no time utilized any pressure. After mentioning I wanted a few days to go over the information she provided my wife and I, she quickly furnished me with a relatively easy way to contact her.

A few days later I called and Sylvia surprised me as she remembered our conversation of a few days earlier and immediately picked up where we left off. With her knowledge, guidance, and cheerfully responding to my many additional questions I completed the purchase.

In summation, if I was Sylvia's rating supervisor she would be a ""Keeper."""

AARDY,"AARDY, Provided us a variety of plans to choose from with different providers. Cheaper than Allianz with much larger insurance coverages to choose from, what really surprised me was the CFAR Coverage which airline insurance does not 🚫 provide as an option. In addition the 150% Travel Interruption Coverage. We are traveling domestically so our health insurance covers our emergency evac, and unexpected illnesses should one arise. But the additional medical and evac coverage is a Plus, for the same low cost in travel insurance."
Easy to obtain and no hassle or hidden fees,"I forgotten all about the cruise insurance the day before I flew out at the 11th Hour I was able to obtain great insurance with no hassles and no hidden fees.

The tips on this website plus an example that used real pre-existing medical conditions plus gave a highlighted option to consider (with underlying rationale for why the policy was highlighted) was a great start. Next, AARDY's knowledgeable and pleasant reps answered my questions and made me comfortable that the reasonably priced policy I'd chosen actually covered what I wanted. I had to leave before finalizing the transaction. When I returned it was obvious that the handoff/pickup from Rep 1 to Rep 2 was well done and the final details were easy to complete. In addition, AARDY was open until 9 pm & immediately emailed the documents! Thank you! I can't think of anything at this point to suggest that would have improved my experience."

My experience with AARD was an outstanding one.,"There are so many things that made this experience an outstanding one. As promised in an article by AARP, the website provided me with a comprehensive list of travel insurance policies which seemed to best fit my needs. The online format used to present this list made my initial comparison of costs and program features a relatively easy one. With all of that being said, what really made this experience truly outstanding was the assistance that I received from Kayla. Once I had narrowed my choices down to three or four policies, I called AARDY. Kayala answered my call and took the time the time needed to address both the specific policy questions and the concerns that I had as related to my travel needs. She was both patient and knowledgeable in her explanations throughout the process. When I made my decision and called Kayla a second time to purchase my travel insurance policy, I felt well informed and confident in my decision. You can be assured that based upon this experience, not only will I be turning to AARDY again in the future, but I will be enthusiastically recommending it to friends as well."

Great experience with superb communication,"Thank you to everyone we spoke with as we planned our trip and insurance needs. I appreciated the professional, informed, patience, and courteous demeanor of all. I made a total of three phone calls ad spoke to George, Jamie, and Don (I believe in that order).
The first call was an informational phone call to gain information on the company, coverage, and overview of services. I was comfortable with doing business with AARDY as a result of the call. Insurance is important and feeling at ease establishing a new relationship with an insurance company is positive. George was thoroughly knowledgeable and able to address all my questions in a welcoming and caring manner.
My second call was to discuss pricing estimates for a policy. I did not at that time have a clear total for my expenditures yet Jamie assured me we could change our coverage up to the date of travel and that was reassuring. I chose to gather up my costs before signing up for a policy.
Don helped me sign up for a policy on my third call. He was great and reviewed all the information from the previous two calls. Don went over the coverage in detail and discussed various scenarios that might be covered which was very informational and gave me a better sense of the extent of the coverage. At that time I bought the travel insurance.
In summary: Every employee was great to work with. They all had immediate access to information from my previous calls.

First time getting Travel Insurance,"Working with AARDY was a pleasant experience. The Website was easy to maneuver and the quotes were detailed. I had a few extra questions since this was my 1st time... so I had a text chat with Miranda to get some more details. She was very helpful and answered all my questions clearly. When it came to some comparative questions, she quickly and correctly surmised that a phone conversation would be much more efficient! So in for the rescue came Andrea. She called me and explained some nuances of travel insurance that I needed to know for my decision. Because of them I made a decision that I am confident will be my best course of action. Thanks you both very much."

Medical travel insurance is a must!!,"I purchased a promise of coverage from AARDY in case of the unthinkable. My existing health coverage in the states is an HMO & it wont extend coverage beyond the US. This is typical of most if not all health insurance coverage. Even non-hmo insurance has very strict limits on international coverage. They usually will only reimburse you a very small percentage of the expenses you incurred. I don’t travel with a medical team or a life-flight crew so did the next best thing & made this very responsible purchase.
Side note: I am healthy individual, i don’t have any underlying conditions despite that, an illness abroad is not something i want to gamble with.
The process was simple and clear. AARDY is a marketplace with a great selection of plans. The rates are very reasonable. I put in a lot of time researching travel insurance. I wanted decent limits that included medevac option. Some people would rather not spend the extra money but its a necessary investment. I am a former claims adjudicator, i have a low risk threshold. I plan on making then my go-to for all my insurance travel needs. Nice touch with the “welcome back home” email. Thanks for being in the shadows & giving me a piece of mind. Glad I didn’t need you."

Asking for a rating before we travel? or even review the policy?…,Asking for a rating before we travel is self-defeating. We have no idea if AARDY is a good company or not. The cost of the policy is 8.3% of the cost of the air fare for the trip. AARDY has not even sent us a policy to review yet.

Beware of purchasing through Aardy.com,"Aardy was helpful in finding relevant policies and providing insurors' documentation. But purchasing a policy through Aardy was a serious mistake. The policy documents shown on Aardy said you had the option to buy upgrades at time of purchase. In fact, once you hit ""Purchase"" you have no option to do anything. Correcting this through the insurer itself is almost impossible, and it is not clear at all that the problem can be resolved. NEVER USE AARDY OR ANY 3rd PARTY WEBSITE TO BUY INSURANCE - ONLY DO IT THROUGH THE INSURANCE COMPANY'S OWN WEBSITE!"

Very happy so far…,"Finding the right trip insurance can be a daunting task, especially for seniors making an international trip during the era of Covid. How much is too much, or not enough? What’s actually covered and what isn’t? AARDY helped demystify all this with good recommendations and coverage comparisons, and when I had a question and called customer service, the response I received was both prompt and helpful. We haven’t taken our trip yet, so I have no experience with making an actual claim, which as with all insurance will hopefully be unnecessary. It’s also the reason for a four-star rather than five-star review. As of now, however, we feel we’ve made a good choice for good coverage with a reputable and responsible company at a fair price."

She offered the same wonderful assistance, and supported the plan that Brandon had come up with for me. She revised our plan a bit to include some updated information, and I signed up. What amazing customer service! I felt like I was being helped by a family member. I have complete trust in Aardy.com, and the services they offer. It made buying trip insurance easy, understandable, and gave me the peace of I was hoping for. Thank you Brandon and Sarah!"

AARDY is a travel STAPLE,"I've used AARDY before pre- COVID but it's a travel staple now post-COVID. AARDY price quotes are the best especially on the benefits value!
I understand all the legalities but if you do not AARDY is more than willing to help you understand what you are purchasing.
Many travelers don't realize if a medical emergency or evacuation is required and you don't have travel insurance you will have to come out the pocket for the disruption of your vacation. The baggage claim feature alone is priceless and a higher claim amount than most credit cards as those only cover the cardholder and not the entire travel party.
Also look for primary vs secondary coverage. With primary coverage you don't need to call whomever else first to file a claim and if there's still a loss balance that's when secondary coverage kicks in. Primary is one and done.
AARDY is my travel insurance guardian angel lol"
